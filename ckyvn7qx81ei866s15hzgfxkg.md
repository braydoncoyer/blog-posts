## 6 BEST Fonts for Programming in 2022

If youâ€™re looking for a fresh font at the beginning of the year, this list is sure to help you discover a few new favorites!

Monospaced fonts are often considered ideal for programmers, as all characters occupy the exact same width making it easy to check, align or compare text.

## 1: MonoLisa

Remaining in the #1 slot from last year, MonoLisa features a few unique techniques that increase the legibility and make it visually pleasant to look at for longer periods of time. 

While MonoLisa is a premium font, it no doubt sticks out as unique even with a quick glance.

A font released by Microsoft and available by default with each Windows installation, Consolas provides an elegant monospaced typeface that many developers choose to use as their daily driver.

## 4: Monofur

Monofur, an elegant and free typeface designed by Tobias Benjamin KÃ¶hler, is a monospace font that isnâ€™t as widely known as it should be.

Each character is crafted with specific meaning and provides an easy-on-the-eyes option for programmers who spend a lot of time in front of the computer screen.
